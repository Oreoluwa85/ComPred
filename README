This is a series of scripts to produce a taxonomy tree adjacent heatmap corresponding to presence or absence of any protein component of each protein complex identified in the EBI Complex Portal (Meldal et al, 2021). The scripts require python3, SQLite3 and Perl. The scripts are to be called as follows:

Complex_Portal_Retrieval.sh: Download latest release of complex portal data as TSVs and corresponding FASTA files, then concatenate each into a single query file. The FASTA file is for querying the database and the TSV (which has complex and protein accession numbers) is for indexing the results of the sequence search
diamond_blastp_query.sh: This is the diamond protein search script that searches a DIAMOND database for the FASTA sequences in the concatenated file from the previous step.
Concat_results: This script concatenates and removes duplicate hits of each query FASTA for each taxon from the resulting DIAMOND BLAST or HMMER3 results table.
make_compdb.sh: This script creates a SQLite3 database, with the concatenated Complex_Portal_Retrieval.sh indexing table and the de-duplicated DBLAST/H3 results table.
Get_taxid_newick.py: This script creates a newick tree from a text file contaning a list of NCBI taxon IDs.  
make_resultsgrid.r: This script creates the resultsgrid.csv, a matrix of presence or absence of protein complexes.

NEED TO:
	MAKE AN R SCRIPT THAT TAKES IN THE OUTPUT SQLITE3 DB FILENAME FROM MAKE_COMPDB.SH
	MAKE A SCRIPT THAT FINDS THE CORRESPONDING ALIGNMENT FROM EACH UNIPROT ACCESSION AND TO MAKE AN ALIGNMENT, WHICH CAN BE USED TO MAKE A PROFILE
	MAKE A SCRIPT THAT QUERIES EACH PROTEIN IN EACH PROTEOME ATTACHED TO EACH GENOME AGAINST EACH PROTEIN'S HMM
